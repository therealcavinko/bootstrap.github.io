        Calvin Cao is my name. From central Massachusetts. I am currently in this class
        at the moment and am typing what they call a "code." I can't believe i'm
        actually doing this right now. THIS IS CRAZY!   This is turning into a blog and i'm writing an update
         on my life more than a bio, but whatever, its all good.                I really hope this works, 
         haven't tested it yet. I'm just typing away at the keyboard write now trying to get the 
         "paragraph or two" im suppose to write.                I really don't know why i'm taking this 
         part so seriously because this ain't english class whatsoever. But anyways, this "blog" 
         or "bio" is all set I think. Have a good day!
